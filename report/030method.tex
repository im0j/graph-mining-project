The main motivation behind our method
is to handle spikes carefully.
Since the input signals are noisy, with bursty noise,
traditional methods like time-warping and wavelets
will focus on the spikes, and ignore the rest of the signal,
giving misleading results.

Our proposed method is as follows: 
We will use the spike-detection method of $\ldots$,
to remove spikes, and only then,  we use the $k$ strongest
Daubechies-4 wavelet coefficients, to compare the two (spike-removed)
sound clips.

$\ldots$
